<b>Title:</b> Deep Neural Networks To Analyze Deformable Shapes From Images<br>
<b>Abstract:</b> The past decade has witnessed the success of deep neural networks (DNNs) in image processing and computer vision, achieving groundbreaking performance on specialized tasks such as image classification, segmentation, object detection, and tracking. Inspired by the human visual system, DNN models were widely believed to learn features from images including texture, color, and the shape of objects. However, recent studies have revealed that DNNs have a strong bias towards seeing image textures rather than shapes. The inability of DNNs to analyze shape as humans do limits their power and potential practical impact in applications where shape is important. In this talk, I will present our recent research on teaching DNNs to learn deformable shapes from images, and how this approach can be leveraged to improve current deep learning (DL) algorithms in image analysis and computer vision. Specifically, I will introduce a new family of low-dimensional shape representation learning algorithms based on fine-grained deformations derived from images.  I will also showcase the practical impact of this research in real-world clinical applications, such as neurodegenerative diseases (i.e., Alzheimerâ€™s) detection and real-time image-guided navigation systems for neurosurgery. <br></p>

<p align="justify">Dr. Steve pizer was the author of the first PhD dissertation in medical image computing, at Harvard and Mass. General Hospital in 1967. He has been teaching, research advising, writing, and doing research in that area continuously since then. In past years his research focused on image quality restoration, 2D and 3D display, and models of human vision. For the last decade he led research on computer vision methods using deep learning to reconstruct surfaces viewed by endoscopic video, most recently in colonoscopy. For the last 4 decades his focus has been on geometric models of anatomic objects, statistical analyses of these, and the applications of that in object segmentation, registration, and diagnosis. My medical target problems have come from radiation oncology, neuroscience, GI medicine, radiology, neurosurgery, and dentistry. The form of model he has developed is skeletal, and in particular what we call the s-rep, with its advantages over object boundary based models of also locally capturing curvature of the object interior and cross-object width. There have been successes of a variety of types for statistics on s-reps. These include the Slicer/SALT toolkit, operating as investigator, and the commercial success of the company, Morphormics, now part of Accuray, that Dr. Pizer and his team spun off and whose main product, doing segmentation originally built upon statistics of skeletal models and of the object-relative intensity patterns they allow, has measured success and is available in many hospitals.<br><br>
